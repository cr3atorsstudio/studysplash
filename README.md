# Overview

StudySplash is a groundbreaking cohort-based learning platform where users are uniquely identified by ERC6551. Users securely sign in using Worldcoin and WalletConnect, then craft personal avatars via ERC6551. These avatars can be linked to multiple groups, like 'Design 101', 'Figma Variables', or 'Midjourney for Creators', all designed using ERC1155. By etching learning milestones and achievements onto the blockchain as permanent digital certificates, we foster a stronger bond among learners and boost their commitment, making it less likely they'll drop out and more likely they'll stay motivated

# How it's Made

The unique aspect of our project is that we treat ERC6551 as the user's wallet. With avatars created using ERC6551, you can associate multiple groups crafted with ERC1155.

Upon their first login, users can authenticate themselves using either WalletConnect and WorldCoin, and are prompted to create their own account abstraction wallet with ERC6551 capabilities.

We've designed our platform to be user-friendly. Images are stored through IPFS and retrieved via Airstack, ensuring quick and efficient access.

Our contracts are deployed on scroll, Base, Gnosis Chain, and Polygon. We have a project plan in place to ensure smooth implementation and integration of these technologies, and we're prepared to tackle any potential challenges that may arise.

While we've made efforts to ensure the security of our project, we acknowledge that due to the nature of the hackathon, it may not be as robust or secure as a fully developed product. We encourage users to keep this in mind.

This project offers a thrilling dive into the capabilities of these technologies, and we're keenly anticipating its evolution. Your insights and recommendations are highly valued
